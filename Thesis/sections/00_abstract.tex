Radical innovations have the power to disrupt whole technological fields, and
are often seen as a key factor in long term growth. Identifying how radical
innovations are is therefore critical. In this thesis, we perform a manual
assessment of some interesting innovations in the field of diagnostic medical
imaging. The assessment will be performed based on a framework proposed by
\cite{verhoeven}. This framework contains three dimensions: novelty of knowledge
origins, novelty of functional origins and technological impact. The resulting
scores can be used for future research, for example to optimize the framework.
