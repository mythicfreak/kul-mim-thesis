Radical innovations have the power to disrupt whole technological fields, and
are often seen as a key factor in long term growth. Therefore it is critical to
identify how radical innovations are. In this thesis, we perform a manual
assessment of five interesting innovations in the field of diagnostic medical
imaging: digital radiography, electron beam computed tomography, magnetic
resonance imaging, 18F-FDG tracers in nuclear medicine and the application of
computer aided detection and diagnosis in mammography. The assessment will be
performed based on a framework proposed by \cite{verhoeven}. This framework
contains three dimensions: novelty of knowledge origins, novelty of
functionality  and technological impact. The resulting scores can be used for
future research, for example to optimize the framework.
