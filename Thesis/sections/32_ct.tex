\section{CT invention: Electron-beam CT} %US 4352021 A (Boyd, 1982)
Our next assessment deals with an innovation related to computed tomography. In
particular, we take a closer look at Electron-beam Computed Tomography (EBCT),
also know as Ultrafast CT.

\subsection{Defining the technology}
Traditional CT scanners have an X-ray tube embedded in the toroid body. By
mechanically rotating the tube along with the detector, projections from an
arbitrary angle can be captured.

EBCT also needs to be able to capture projections from any angle, but takes
another route. Remember that in a regular X-ray tube current flowing through the
cathode releases electrons. The electrons are accelerated towards the anode by
applying a voltage across the tube. When the electrons hit the anode at high
speed, they release part of their energy as X-rays. The same principle is used
in EBCT, except that the tube is physically split up in two dedicated parts. One
is the cathode or electron gun and is placed along the patient's longitudinal
axis. The other is the anode and is shaped in a semi-ring around the patient.
Using magnetic fields, the electrons fired from the cathode are deflected onto this
ring, where they produce X-rays that can be captured by a detector array as
usual \cite{suetens}. \autoref{fig:ebctscanner} illustrates this.

The main advantage of this setup is that the X-ray source rotation is no longer
mechanical. This allows for faster sweeps, which in turn make it easier to image
moving structures such as the heart. In traditional CT scanners, this movement
would cause blurring in the final image, and thus a loss of diagnostic value.
One very prominent EBCT application is the detection of calcifications from
atherosclerosis in the coronal arteries (i.e., coronary artery disease)
\cite{ultrafastcad}. These are very close to the heart, and can move by about
five times their own diameter every heartbeat.

More recently, these EBCT scanners have received strong competition from
multislice helical CT scanners. The latter enjoy a widespread adoption and are
also less costly (partly due to economies of scale and increased competition).
However, their rotation speed still cannot match that of Ultrafast CT
\cite{ultravshelical}. In addition, this techniques requires a lower dose
compared to traditional CT, and much lower than a CT angiography
\cite{ultralowdose}. The latter is a common alternative for diagnosing coronary
artery disease when an EBCT scanner is not available.

In conclusion, this technique is promising for non-invasive detection of
coronary heart disease, but it has too many unsolved problems to replace general
purpose CT scanners \cite{multictbook}.

\subsection{Assessing novelty in functionality}

\subsubsection{Novelty in components}
As outlined above, the components are largely the same as in conventional CT
scanners. Only their location is different. One additional component is the coil
to generate the deflecting magnetic field. Such electromagnets were used before
in imaging, particularly in MRI, but for a very different purpose.

\subsubsection{Novelty in natural effects exploited}
The same story applies for novelty in natural effects exploited: few new effects
except bending of the electron beam using magnetic fields. The same principle
was used much earlier in Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) monitors and televisions.

\subsubsection{Scores}
In \autoref{tbl:funcscores2} we give an overview of the scores on the various
topics.

\end{table}

\subsection{Assessing novelty in knowledge origins}
Again, we look into the problems that had to be solved to find the knowledge
origins. We only look at the problems that are different in comparison to a
traditional CT scanner.

Problem 1: deflect the electron beam onto the anode ring.

Solution 1: use magnetic fields (electric field deflection only works for small angles)

KO1: electromagnetism, CRT monitors

Problem 1.1: overcoming Coulomb repulsion to obtain proper beam focus

Solution 1.1: leak nitrogen into vacuum chamber \cite{ebctelectric}

KO2: charged particle optics

Problem 2: synchronise imaging with heart rhythm

Solution 2: use ECG equipment

KO3: biomedical sensors, signal processing

\subsubsection{Scores}
Electromagnetism, charged particle optics and signal processing can be
considered scientific origins, while the others are technological in nature.

Note that using ECG equipment to synchronise imaging with the heart rhythm is
not new. It was occasionally used before in various other imaging modalities
\cite{suetens}.

\autoref{tbl:origscores2} shows the scores.

\subsection{Assessing technological impact}
\subsubsection{Performance increase}
As outlined above, EBCT is very useful for mainly one thing: imaging the heart
and its periphery. However, there are serious drawbacks that do not make it
useful as a general purpose CT scanner. For example, due to the new geometry
X-ray scatter cannot be reduced as effectively. This in turn generates extra
artifacts on the resulting image. The electron gun also has limited power making
it inadequate for higher dosage (i.e., higher contrast) studies \cite{multictbook}.

\subsubsection{Technological accumulation}
Surprisingly, we were unable to identify any newer invention based on EBCT.
Various other applications using electron beams were checked, such as electron
microscopes and electron beam lithography, but none seem to be based on
innovations in EBCT. This may be caused by the relative obscurity of EBCT
outside of medical imaging fields.

\subsubsection{Obsoleting previous technologies}
EBCT has definitely not obsoleted previous technologies. Its application area is
simply too narrow for many hospitals to warrant such an expensive purchase.
Instead, older and cheaper but less effective methods are still used more often
to diagnose coronary artery disease. Examples include a CT angiography, exercise
stress tests but also invasive (catheter) examinations.
