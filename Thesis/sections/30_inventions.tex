\section{Introduction} %TODO check count
In this chapter, we perform the assessment of five inventions based on the
framework described in \autoref{chap:intro}. \autoref{chap:imaging} already
described various breakthroughs in diagnostic medical imaging, but most of them
predate 1980. Fortunately researchers in the field have come up with plenty of
other innovations in the last thirty years, some of which will be detailed
below. We included one invention per imaging modality described, plus one more
related to computer aided diagnosis (CAD).

For each innovation, a technological definition is provided wherein the purpose
or goal is outlined, and the components plus their interactions are explained.
Next, the innovation is scored based on the assessment sheet in the appendix. Of
course the scores are substantiated with literature references where needed.
