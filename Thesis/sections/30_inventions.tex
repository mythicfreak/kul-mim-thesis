\chapter{Overview of radical inventions}\label{chap:inventions}

\section{Introduction} %TODO check count
In this chapter, we perform the assessment of five inventions based on the
framework described in \autoref{chap:intro}. \autoref{chap:imaging} already
described various breakthroughs in diagnostic medical imaging, but most of them
predate 1980. Fortunately researchers in the field have come up with plenty of
other innovations in the last thirty years, some of which will be detailed
below. We included one invention per imaging modality described, plus one more
related to computer aided diagnosis (CAD).

For each innovation, a technological definition is provided wherein the purpose
or goal is outlined, and the components plus their interactions are explained.
Next, the innovation is scored based on the assessment sheet in the appendix. Of
course the scores are substantiated with literature references where needed.

\section{Conclusion}
In this chapter, we presented the results of the assessment of various
innovations related to diagnostic medical imaging. We tried to be as varied as
possible in the selection of innovations. Not only did they all stem from a
different field, but their scope and type also varied. For example, we tried a
high-level assessment of MRI as a whole, but also assessment of a whole class of
algorithms and specific pharmaceutical compounds.

We have tried to make this assessment as detailed as possible. However, medical
imaging is a very complex matter, and even our introduction in
\autoref{chap:imaging} - much like many a review paper - just barely scratch the
surface of all underlying methods and technologies. These details only become
apparent when hands-on work is performed by scientists and researchers in the
field. Consequently, these details will only be present in the most detailed
literature and of course in patent applications. We fear that this discrepancy
in level of detail will significantly hamper comparison with the automated
patent analysis.

The way the framework is built also seems to favor automatic patent based
analysis over manual assessment. The questions on the assessment sheet map
nicely to data that can be extracted from patents. On the other hand, manually
finding an answer to these questions without looking at patent data has proven
to be challenging at times. The granularity of the scores presents another
problem. It is very difficult to explain the difference between, for example, 6
and 5. In that regard we would either propose a rescaled score chart with scores
from 1 to 5. The alternative is to improve the existing score chart with a more
detailed description of how to quantify the small differences in score.

In addition, the 1980 limit made it significantly more difficult to go back to
the real breakthrough invention, the so-called seed. For example, FDG in nuclear
medicine was certainly a breakthrough but it would have been more interesting to
go back further and see who first managed to bring nuclear physics together with
biochemistry and truly invent radiopharmacology. On the other hand, due to the
ex-post nature of some assessment questions (i.e., impact), very recent
innovations cannot be mapped either.

One other aspect we noticed, is that medical imaging research seems to ``stay in
the family'' - so to speak. One imaging modality builds on top of another
modality's knowledge, but the technology hardly seems to diffuse into other
fields. One possible explanation is that biomedical researchers have plenty of
very specific medicine-related journals to choose from for publishing, so they
don't branch out. They do not interact much with journals that have similar
content, but focus on another sector. From personal experience, this is very
apparent in the image processing literature. For example, one can browse image
processing journals from IEEE in vain without finding a solution for a generic
non-medical problem. Meanwhile, medical researchers might have come up with such
a solution years ago, applied it to medicine and published it in a medical image
processing journal.
